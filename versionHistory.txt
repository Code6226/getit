GetIt - Version History
=======================

You can help:
-Does FreewareUpdater have commandline support? If so, please contact me if you know about this

ToDo:
-Move AppSnap before AppUpdater (since AppSnap will install newest version)
-Redo GetIt GUI from scratch into a proper GUI (Show App list right away, File Menu for other features, resizable, every X day reminder to run 'updatedb')
-.Git files of "Application" type (like a self-contained mini-repository of a single app - no other repositories required to install that app)
-Look into Unattended, WPKG

No longer planned:
-Support injecting repositories into Appupdater (currently only AppSnap repositories are supported, little/no demand from people to host their own repositories)


===============
Version History
===============

>2011.08.31
-Reintegrated old changes left out in the last release
-Updated downloaded AppUpdater to v1.5

>2011.08.30
-AppSnap is no longer included by default since the repository seems outdated
-Run 'getit.exe getenginesall' to add AppSnap support
-Accidently excluded some old changes

>2009.10.20
-Fixed GUI not being run by Installer (GUI is the one who does the file association to .git files, so if you never ran it yourself, the start-menu install shortcuts wouldn't have worked)

>2009.10.13 "Quiet"
--Basically, once it starts installing, it should just keep on setting everything up without any further message boxes, unless there is an update to GetIt
-No longer asks if you want to install AppSnap/AppUpdater (will always do it, unless already installed)
-No longer reports which App-Getters were detected (They all better have been, since they were just installed for you, if not existant)
-No longer runs GUI after install
-AppSnap is now higher priority than AppUpdater by default (more likely to give you newest version)

>2009.10.08 "Hi Windows 7"
-You can now install applications from the Windows 7/Vista start menu search (Just search for what you want, click Install)
-Added start-menu shortcut to Update Repositories
-Updated auto-downloaded AppUpdater to v1.2.1

>2009.04.12 "Portable"
-You can now make GetIt portable (just insert your USB Stick and click "Make Portable" in GUI)
-Added support for installing GetIt to a different drive than where AppSnap/AppUpdater are installed to
-Fixed getting "====..." application from Appupdater repository (needed to skip 3 lines rather than 2 in applist)

>2009.01.10
-Fixed installer window being in front of initial 'getengines' message box
-updatedb: Moved "Downloading Repository" text up to not cut off longer URLs

>2009.01.07 "Chain and Able"
-Chain Install supported!
--GUI lets you select multiple applications with Ctrl, then install them all in a row, without pause
--GUI also lets you create a Batch file of your selected Chain Install for later use
-getit 'install': getit will now close right after the install is done, even if the cmd log is still visible (No more having to hit Enter to continue install chain)
-getit 'getengines' will now automatically move into updating your repositories afterwards
-Updater automatically calls 'getengines' after updates now (which is a good thing to do ;p)
-Auto-installing AppSnap/Appupdater informs you of why the download failed now, if it failed

[Puchisoft Repository]
-Added Dispatcher
-Fixed GetIt version format (not that you are going to install GetIt with GetIt... I hope! ;p)

>2009.01.06
-GetIt 'getengines' will now offer to download and silently install AppUpdater/AppSnap rather than just opening the website for you
-getit 'install' can now be run one after another without them running into each other (useful for batch files; this is the groundwork for official installChain support)
--will also wait for needed app-engine to close before launching it (fixes issue with running multiple single installs seperately)
-Win-Get removed as a default App-Getting Engine (Its Database has been offline for a while)
--It's still included: If you want to re-enable it, just add "Win-Get" to the end of your preference.txt 
-Can now use "installr"/"installu" instead of "installrefresh"/"installupgrade" in FARR (alias change)
-Added Progress bar when downloading Repositories or things via getit://
-AppSnap no longer Pauses after updating its main repository (Appupdater didn't either) [Requires running 'getengines' again]
-Cleaned up GUI, replaced 2nd Quit button with Check For Updates to GetIt
-Fixed getit.exe not closing in certain cases

>2008.12.03
-GUI can now be closed using a normal windows X
-Cleaned up GUI

>2008.11.21
